<h>Jerboa</h>

<p>When chased, jerboas can run at up to 24 kilometres per hour</p>


<p>Most jerboas rely on plant material as the main component of their diet, but they cannot eat hard seeds. Some species opportunistically eat beetles and other insects they come across. Unlike gerbils, jerboas are not known to store their food</p>
